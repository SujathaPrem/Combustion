<title> Chapter 4 : Combustion </title>
<body>
<h1>FUN FACTS</h1>
<p><b>Who discovered combustion?</b><br/><br/>
French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier posited the first approximation of the true nature of combustion: he discovered in 1772 that the products of burned sulfur or phosphorus—in effect their ashes—outweighed the initial substances, and he postulated that the increased weight was due to their having combined with air. Interestingly, it was already known that metals transformed by heat to metallic ash weighed less than the metallic ash. </p>
